This code was used to produce results of the paper 
"The role of new neurons and axonal time delays in the emergence of precisely timed bursts in songbird HVC".
It implements an unsupervised growth of spiking biological neural networks. 
The growth is guided by Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity. A key novelty of our approach is 
incorporation of new immature neurons into the network during the growth. In addition, the existence
of considerable axonal conduction delays between neurons shapes the network topology starting from synfire
chains in the limit of now delays to polychronous networks in the limit of wide axonal delay distribution.
More details will be provided when the paper is published.
